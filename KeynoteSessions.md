**Deep Customized Kubernetes for Machine Learning in Tencent - Shengbo Song, Tencent**

The Kubernetes and Tensorflow are playing an important role in machine learning, However, the original Kubernetes doesn't serve machine learning well, lacks of accurate GPU scheduling policy, GPU topology awareness and resource limitation etc. In this presentation, we will review recent events about machine learning in Kubernetes community, give us a overview of what changes have been made to Kubernetes to support machine learning in Tencent, the challenges it faces, and look forward to how to address the challenges.

**Migrating Enterprise Microservices From Cloud Foundry to Kubernetes – Tony Erwin & Jonathan Schweikhart, IBM**

Historically, the forty microservices making up the IBM Cloud UI have been deployed as apps on Cloud Foundry (CF), an open source PaaS. But, recently, this enterprise microservice system has been migrated to run on Kubernetes to take advantage of improved orchestration, higher availability, and better performance. Tony Erwin & Jonathan Schweikhart will discuss their journey and provide insights into the advantages of Kube over CF. Even more importantly, they will describe approaches to solving new problems that took the place of old ones, such as: 1) adapting PaaS apps to run as containers on Kube, 2) enabling geo load balancing between the different platforms (to vet Kube before entirely replacing CF), 3) integrating tools like Prometheus into existing monitoring systems, and more! Their team's experiences will help you avoid pitfalls as you look to perform your own migrations to Kube!

**Kubernetes Native DevOps Practice - Lei Wang, TenxCloud**

This topic will cover a new approach that we used to build DevOps solution on top of Kubernetes. We find it's quite easy to setup, use and maintain, it can also leverage lots of existing features from PaaS if we're building both. Here is the agenda:
1. Our DevOps Expectations - Easy to use/scale/extend; high availability; a superset, can integrate with existing CI/CD tools
2. Kubernetes capabilities and advantages to build DevOps solution - Pod/Job/CrontJob/InitContainer/Resource management/Scheduling
3. Architecture and features
 - CRD and operator design
 - Pipeline/Stage/Task/Task Template/Version Control/UI generation/Volume...
 - Logging, monitoring, autoscaling, high availability
 - Extensibility/Integration
 - CI/CD examples
4. Future plan - ChatOps/AIOps - Enterprise users are actively using this solution, bring consistent user experience and generate consistent system metrics, make DevOps easier.

**Container Networking Untangling Services Meshes and SDNs - Gregory Elkinbard, GSE Software**

Horizontally scalable applications need reliable and scalable networking, traffic routing to the correct instance and security policy enforcement. Traditionally SDNs have delivered these functions. However recently Service Meshes began to encroach on the tranditional SDN space. 

This presentation will compare 3 services meshes Istio, Linkerd and Conduit vs a more traditional SDN such as OpenContrail in the Kubernetes cluster environment. We will go over the features of each one of these products and compare their Kubernetes integrations against each other.

**A Day in the Life of a Data Scientist. Conquer ML Lifecycle on Kubernetes - Rita Zhang & Brian Redmond, Microsoft** 

*keywords* **kubeflow** 

Ever wondered how machine learning models are built? Well, here’s your opportunity to come spend a day in the life of a data scientist. This will be a practical guide to the day-to-day lifecycle of a machine learning model. Dive end-to-end through code collaboration, dataset preparation, training and serving. We will cover how to utilize open source tools like Kubeflow and offer an in-depth view of how they operate and aide the machine learning development lifecycle. This session is for both data scientists and infrastructure/SRE teams alike helping bring the benefits of DevOps to AI and machine learning.
